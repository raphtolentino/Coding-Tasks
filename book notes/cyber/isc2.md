### Chapter 1 - Security Principals

### Module 1: Understand the Security Concepts of Information Assurance

1. CIA Triad

What is the CIA triad ?

- The purpose of the CIA triad is to provide relevant security knowledge using easy words.

### **********************Confidentiality**********************

Characteristics of preventing the disclosure of information/data to unauthorised persons. For example Passport id number is confidential as its contain sensitive information.

Its important to follow regulations:

****HIPAA Regulations:****

- **PII (Personally Identifiable Information) r**efers to any data about an individual that could be used to identify them.
- ******************************************PHI (Personally Health Information)****************************************** refers to any health data about an individual that could be used to identify them.
- **********Classified or Sensitive Information********** is also a factor that involves trade secrets, research and other IPs.

### ******************Integrity******************

Characteristics of data or system content being completed, correct and consistent.

- ********************Data Integrity******************** refers to the assurance that data has not been altered by an unauthorised manner. This requires that the data is free from modifications, errors, loss of information; and it's recorded, used and maintained safely that ensures completeness.
- ****************System Integrity**************** refers to the assurance that data is secure in a safe manner free from unauthorised access or manipulation, both intentional or not. It involves creating and maintaining good configuration.

The data or system integrity state can modify by comparing the baseline against the current state. If these two factors match, the system is secured.

### ****************************Availability****************************

- Characteristics of timely and reliably access to information and being able to use it. For authorised users to have timely, reliable access to data and information.
- This does not mean that data/system need to be available 100% of the time. But, the data/system need to meet timely and reliability requirements.

## Module 2 : Understand the Risk Management Process

### Key Words ðŸ”‘

**Asset**: Something in need of protection

**Vulnerability**: Gap or weakness in protection efforts

**Threat**: Something or Someone that aims to exploit vulnerability to access assets. 

Probability: The changes or likelihood, that a given threat can happen or exploited

Likelihood: The probability that a potential vulnerability may be exploited within the threat environment. 

--------------------------

### Risk Assessment

The analysis performed part of the Risk Management which incorporates threats and vulnerabilities analyses and consider mitigations provided by security control planned or in place.

The result of the risk assessment process is documented as a report or presentation given to management for their use in fixing security flaws. 

### Risk Treatment

The determination of the best way to address a identified risk.

### Risk Avoidance

Risk avoidance is the decision to attempt to eliminate the risk entirely

### Risk Acceptance

Risk acceptance is taking no action to reduce the likelihood of a risk occurring.

### Risk Mitigation

Risk mitigation is the most common type of risk management and includes taking actions to prevent or reduce the possibility of a risk event or its impact.

### Risk Transference

Risk transference is the practice of passing the risk to another party, who will accept the financial impact of the harm resulting from a risk being realized in exchange for payment. Typically, this is an insurance policy.

### Risk Tolerance

The level of risk an entity is willing to assume in order to achieve a potential desired result.
