- Tokens

Thereâ€™s two authentication method types used in security.

- **Single Factor Authentication (SFA)** refers to single methods that does not require extra security to login-in to a system.
- Multi **Factor Authentication (MFA)** refers to single methods that require extra security to login-in to a system.

### 0.3.2. Authorisation

Characteristics of giving users access to certain data of a building. It is used after authentication and can be provided in several ways:

- Permission

- Time of Day restrictions
- Login or Physical restrictions

### 0.3.3. Accounting

Characteristics of tracking data, computer usage and network resources. It involves having proof if someone performed unauthorised actions. It involves:

- Logging
- Auditing
- Monitoring of data and resources

<aside>
ðŸ”‘ It can be broken into 5 categories:

Something the users knows:

- Username and Password / Pin

Something the user has:

- Smart card and other security item

Something the user is:

- Biometric reading or Fingerprints or retina scans
